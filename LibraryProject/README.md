# LibraryProject

This is a basic Django project created for learning purposes.

## Steps Performed:
- Installed Django using `pip install django`.
- Created the project using `django-admin startproject LibraryProject`.
- Ran the development server using `python manage.py runserver`.
- Accessed the project at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Project Structure:
- **manage.py** – Command-line utility for running tasks like starting the server and creating apps.
- **settings.py** – Stores configuration for the project (database, installed apps, middleware).
- **urls.py** – The "table of contents" of your Django project – maps URLs to views.
